	<div class ="columns_2"><p>The National Archaeological Park of Tierradentro is located in the south-western of Colombia in Andean’s central cordillera, in the municipality of Inzá, department of Cauca. Four areas, dispersed over a few square kilometres, make up the archaeological park: Alto de San Andrés, Alto de Segovia, Alto del Duende, El Tablón and as a site of importance but outside the park boundary the Alto del Aguacate. The park contains all known monumental shaft and chamber tombs of Tierradentro culture, the largest and most elaborate tombs of their kind.</p>
		<p>The area was once home to a pre-Columbian culture which, for want of a better term is called the San Agustin culture as similar pottery and art have been found at both sites . Well over 50 tombs that have been discovered in the area, all underground and originally filled in with earth. most of which are accessible now; the government has excavated them and poured cement around the original stairwells that lead down into the tombs to protect them from erosion or other damage. Some have interior walls completely painted in motifs of red (life), black (death), and white (hope of making it to the next life). each one has a domed ceiling supported by at least two columns. </p> </div>

	<div class ="columns_2"><p>The present state of archaeological and anthropological knowledge suggests that the builders of the hypogea (underground tombs) lived in the mountain slopes and valleys in the area. In the valleys they established small settlements whereas on the hillsides settlement was dispersed, close to the fields. The oval-plan residential sites were built on artificial terraces, with rammed earth floors. The wooden frames were filled with wattle-and-daub and the roofs were thatched. There were no internal divisions and there was a single combustion zone, with wooden benches for sleeping.</p>

<p>The Spaniards called the region Tierradentro, suggested to be either because of the mountainous topography of the area, which generates the sensation of being closed in, or perhaps following the same theme, because of the numerous funerary Hypogea cut from the rock, filled with funerary remains and soil, so that the inhabitants were literally buried ‘Dentro da Tierra’ both within the Hypogea and the mountains surrounding them.</p> </div>

	<div class ="columns_2"><p>The National Archaeological Park of Tierradentro is well known for its pre-Columbian hypogea, which were found in several excavations and in various archeological locations.</p>

		<p>The typical hypogeum has an entry oriented towards the west, a spiral staircase and a main chamber, usually 5 to 8 meters below the surface, with several lesser chambers around, each one containing a corpse. The walls are painted with geometric, anthropomorphic and zoomorphic patterns in red, black and white. Some statues and remains of pottery and fabrics can be seen scarcely due to grave robbery before the hypogea were constituted as protected areas.</p>

<p>The precolumbian culture that created this funeral complex inhabited this area during the first millennium A.C. Tierradentro Archaeological park features hypogea dating from 6th to 9th centuries AD. The details in the sculptures and pictoric patterns are similar to the San Agustín culture. </p> </div>

	<div class ="columns_2"><p>Most of our meals were eaten at the restaurant across the street from the hotel. Doña Eva makes excellent home cooked meals, and there are usually two or three choices for lunch and dinner. Meals ranged from COP$10,000 to $17,000.</p>

<p>If you want to try some other places to eat, your choices are limited. La Portada 
has the best (and only) restaurant in San Andrés, but there are a few limited 
choices by the park entrance about a 20 minute walk downhill. They didn’t look 
	appealing at all.</p>

<p>After one hike, there was a woman who set up a tent on the corner near La 
Portada. She was offering a local stew called mote. We decided to sit and try this 
meal, which is basically like traditional Colombian sancocho but with corn and 
beans instead of vegetables. Our meal cost COP$16,000 for two including drinks. </p> </div>
